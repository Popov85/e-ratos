A journalist’s body temperature has sharply increased in the morning three weeks after his mission in India; it was accompanied with shivering and bad headache. A few hours later the temperature decreased. The attacks began to repeat in a day. He was diagnosed with tropical malaria. What stage of development of Plasmodium is infective for anopheles-female?
%!100%Gametocytes
%0%Shizontes
%0%Merozoites
%0%Microgamete
%0%Sporozoites
@Gametocytes. When a female Anopheles mosquito bites a person suffering from malaria, the gametocytes, present in the ingested blood alone survive the digestive action in the stomach of the mosquito.

A 10-year-old child complains of weakness, nausea, irritability. Helminthes of while color and 5-10 mm long were found on the underwear. On microscopy of the scrape from the perianal folds achromic ovums of unsymmetrical form were revealed. Indicate what helminth is parasiting on the child?
%!100%Enterobius vermicularis
%0%Ancylostoma duodenalis
%0%Trichuris
%0%Trichina
%0%Ascaris lumbricoides
@Enterobins vermicularis.Femalesreach fertility within four weeks. They dwell primarily in the caecumof the large intestine, from where the gravid females migrate at night to lay up to 15.000 eggs on the perineum (perianal region). Pinworm eggs are flattened asymmetrically on one side, ovoid, approximately 55 mm x 25 mm in size and embryonate in six hours. The eggs get stuck on skin, underwear or bedding and become infective within a few hours. Eggs survive up to three weeks on clothing, sheets or other objects. After the female has laid eggs it dies. Pinworm infection usually occurs via ingestion of infections eggs by direct anus-to-mouth transfer by fingers

A patient has been brought to the hospital with the complaints of headache, pain in left hypochondrium. He has been ill for 1,5 weeks. The sudden illness began with the increase of body temperature up to 39, 90C. In 3 hours the temperature decreased and hydropoiesis began. The attacks repeat rhythmically in 48 hours. The patient had visited one an African country. The doctors have suspected malaria. What method of laboratory diagnostics is necessary to use?
%!100%Blood examination
%0%Immunological tests
%0%Stool examination
%0%Examination of vaginal and urethral discharge
%0%Urine examination
@Blood examination.The preferred method to diagnose malaria and determine which species of Plasmodium is causing the infection is by examination of a blood film under microscope in a laboratory. Each species has distinctive physical characteristics that are apparent under the microscope. In P. falciparum, only early (ring-form) trophozoites and gametocytes are seen in the peripheral blood. It is unusual to see mature trophozoites or usually sequestered in the tissues.

Slime, blood and protozoa 30-200 microns of length have been revealed in a man’s feces. The body is covered with cilia and has correct oval form with a little bit narrowed forward and wide rounds shaped back end. On the forward end a mouth is visible. In cytoplasm there are two nucleuses and two short vacuoles. For whom are the described attributes typical?
%!100%Balantidium
%0%Lamblia
%0%Dysenteric amoeba
%0%Trichomonas
%0%Intestinal amoeba
@Balantidiumcoliis a parasite that causes the disease balantidiasis.It is the only member of the ciliate phylum known to be pathogenic to humans. Balantidium coli have two developmental stages: a trophozoite stageanda cyst stage. In trophozoites, the two nuclei are visible. The macronucleus is long and sausage-shaped and the spherical micronucleus is nested next to it, often hidden by the macronucleus. The opening, known as the peristome, at the pointed anterior end leads to the cytostome, or the mouth.Cysts are smaller than trophozoites and are round and have a tough, heavy cyst wall made of one or two layers. Usually, only the macronucleus and sometimes cilia and contractile vacuoles are visible in the cyst. Living trophozoites and cysts are yellowish or greenish in colour.

An individual is characterized by rounded face, broad forehead, a Mongolian type of eyelid fold, flattened nasal bridge, permanently open mouth, projecting lower lip, protruding tongue, short neck, flat hands, and stubby fingers. What diagnosis can be put to the patient?
%!100%Down’s syndrome
%0%Klinefelter’s syndrome
%0%Alkaptonuria
%0%Supermales
%0%Turner’s syndrome
@Down’syndrome (trisomy21. Karyotype47 (21 +) Frequency of 1800 newborns. Frequency of a birth with this syndrome is influenced with age of mother (after 36-40 years makes 1:50). The syndrome can be caused of trisomyon 21 pair chromosomes, translocation on21 chromosomes of group D or by mosaisizm. The patient has a number of characteristic attributes: the short limbs, a small skull, anomalies of face structure of the person, anomaly of upper eyelid - epicanthus. The mental retardation expressed in a different degree is observed.

Moving of the daughter chromatids to the poles of the cell is observed in the mitotically dividing cell. On what stage of the mitotic cycle is this cell?
%!100%Anaphase
%0%Metaphase
%0%Telophase
%0%Prophase
%0%Interfase
@Anaphase.At the anaphase the centromere of each chromosome divides in two. The chromatids of the each chromosome are separated and form two daughter chromosomes. The chromosomes become shorter and thicker and migrate towards the oppositepoles of the cell.

A sick man with high temperature and a lot of tiny wounds on the body has been admitted to the hospital. Lice have been found in the folds of his clothing. What disease can be suspected in the patient?
%!100%Epidemic typhus

@Epidemic typhus.Lice distributes relapsing fever and epidemic typhus .The agents of epidemic typhus are Prowache’s Ricketisiae. They intrude lice’s stomach with the blood of an infected person, penetrate into the epithelial cells of the intestine and reproduce 4-7 days; later Rickettsiae are passing out of the louse’s body in its faeces on the skin of the host. A person gets infected while rubbing lice faeces, containing disease agents, into the scratches. Such way of the agent’s transmission is called contamination.

Substitution of the glutamic acid on valine was revealed while examining initial molecular structure. For what inherited pathology is this symptom typical?
%!100%Sickle-cell anemia
%0%Thalassemia
%0%Minkowsky-Shauffard disease
%0%Favism
%0%Hemoglobinosis
@Sickle-cell anemia.In Normal haemoglobin (HbA) the peptide chain consists of – valine – histidine – leucine – threonine –  proline – glutamic acid –glutamic asid –lysine.In Abnormal haemoglobin S (HbS) it is the same, except that glutamic acid at eighth position is replaced by valine. This single gene mutation alters the property of haemoglobin and brings a change in the shape of the red blood corpuscles.Haemoglobin S has low oxygen-carrying capacity, therefore severe anemia results. Genetically, a person suffering from this disease is homozygous and has two dominant genes, one from each parent. A heterozygous condition produces sickle-cell trait.
